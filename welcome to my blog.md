I have put together this blog for anybody who has an interest in Malware and all the geeky stuff that goes along with it. In my current role I do a lot of Malware analysis and thought it would be cool to share some of what I do with the security community.

My plan is to update this blog regularly with reports on any malware that I have actively seen in the wild and feedback the steps taken in my analysis along with the relevant IOC's. I plan to try and keep it varied where possible and also include anything cool that relates to threat hunting and incident response.
