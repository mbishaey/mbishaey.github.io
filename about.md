My name is Michael Bishaey. I have worked in Cyber Security for last 6 years for a major UK Telcom company.

The majority of my time working in cyber security has been in 3rd line/CERT type roles as an escalation point for high priority incidents. This has also included a lot of threat hunting and in my current role a lot of focus on malware analysis and reverse engineering.

I think there is real value in sharing knowledge amongst the cyber security community which is why I decided to setup this site, I will be sharing some of the work I do whether it's malware related or any of the other stuff that i think is particluarly cool/useful relating to incident response.

Michael
