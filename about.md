My name is Michael Bishaey. I have been working in Cyber Security for last 6 years for a major UK Telcom company.

The majority of my time in the field has been in a 3rd line/CERT type roles as an escalation point for high priority incidents. My job also includes threat hunting and lot of focus on malware analysis and reverse engineering.

I also have a great interest in red/purple team tactics and techniques and I try to learn ethical hacking when I have some spare time.

I believe there is real value in sharing knowledge amongst the cyber security community which is why I decided to set up this blog. I will be sharing some of the work that I do and some of the exciting things I learn whether it's malware analysis or ethical hacking that i think is particluarly cool.

I hope you find the content of this blog useful and if you have any questions please do get in touch.

Michael
